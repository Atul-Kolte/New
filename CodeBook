CodeBook
The script "run_analysis.R" runs on the unzipped data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Getting the Dataset

First download the dataset from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and store in the folder Getting_and_cleaning_data
Unzip the downloaded file that creates a subdirectory "UCI HAR Dataset"

Importing the text files into tables

features <- "UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt"             
activity <- "UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt"
testsubjects <- "UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt"
trainsubjects <- "UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt"
x_test <- "UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt"
y_test <- "UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt"
x_train <- "UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt"
y_train <- "UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt"

The imported tables and its dimensions

features  561 Observations and 2 Variables           
activity  6 Observations and 2 Variables
testsubjects 2947 Observations and 1 Variable
trainsubjects  7352 Observations and 1 Variable
x_test 2947 Observations and 561 Variables
y_test 2947 Observations and 1 Variable
x_train 7352 Observations and 561 Variables
y_train 7352 Observations and 1 Variable

Merging the training and test datasets

x_merged file was created by rowbinding (rbind) of x_train an x_test table
y_merged file was created by rowbinding (rbind) of y_train an y_test table
Subjects file was created by rowbinding (rbind) of trainsubjects an testsubjects table

Creating final merged file

The merged_final was creared by merging the Subjects, y_merged, x_merged using column binding (cbind) function

Retaining the columns of interest i.e. containing either 'mean' or 'Standard Deviation' in their name

The new dataset 'Column_Selected' was created by 'select' function of dplyr package  with retaininf the first two columns and other columns containing either "mean" or "std" in the column names

The column names of the 'Column_Selected' table were replaced using gsub command and following replacements were made

"tBodyAcc" =  "TimeBodyAccleration"
"tGravityAcc" = "TimeGravityAccleration"
"tBodyGyro" = "TimeBodyGyroscopy"
"fBodyAcc" = "FrequencyBodyAccleration"
"fBodyGyro" = "FrequencyBodyGyroscopy"
"fBodyBodyAcc" ="FrequencyBodyAccleration"
"fBodyBodyGyro" = "FrequencyBodyGyroscopy"

The table was transformed to provide tidy dataset containing average of each variable for each activity and each subject

The 'Tidy dataset'Column_Selected' data was grouped by Subject and Code followed by summarise all using function 'mean'

The final data name is TidyData with 180 obsevations and 88 variables

The data retained the code column that was remaned as Activity adn the codes were replaced using the column 2 of the activity table created under imported table. 

the TidyData was written to a TidyData.txt file in the working directory
